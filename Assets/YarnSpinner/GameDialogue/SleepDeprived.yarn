You notice that your eyelids are feeling strangely heavy, and you’re starting to have trouble focusing on your screen…
Was it because you solved too many Yeetcode problems? 
Or was it because you didnt drink enough Fahrenheit? 
No, could it be because you haven’t slept in a couple days? 
…Maybe you’ll get to that right after you finish clearing this next domain…
