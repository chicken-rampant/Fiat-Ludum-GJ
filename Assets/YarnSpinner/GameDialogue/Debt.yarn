title: Debt
---
Unfortunately, you felt so stressed that you just needed to pull gacha to relieve your stress.
Even more unfortunately, though, you ended up going through all your allowance but still hadn't pulled what you wanted...
So you decided to resort to stealing your mom's credit card.
Who would have known that you would end up eating through the rent for the month...
And that soon you would be homeless...
